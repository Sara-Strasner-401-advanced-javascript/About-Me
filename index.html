        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>
          Welcome to my About Me page! As you can see above, my name is Sara Strasner, and I am glad to hear that you are interested in learning more about me. <div>I was born and raised in Louisiana, and moved to Seattle in 2013 for graduate school. When I'm not working on this beautiful website, I enjoy running, yoga, and reading. I typically read fiction, and my guilty pleasure is the Outlander series (tv and books!). I also really enjoy travelling. I recently traveled to Ireland and Scotland and immediately loved both places.

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>
          I graduated from Louisiana State University with two Bachelor of Arts degrees in Art History and Spanish. I loved learning about the history of the world through art, plus art is also just really aesthetically pleasing. I pursued a Spanish degree because I love languages and the challenges of mastering the vocabulary, syntax, and usage of a new language. <div> I moved to Seattle to earn my Master's Degree in Museology (Museum Studies) in 2013. I graduated in 2015 and started working in museums soon thereafter.

        <h3>Job Experience</h3>
        <p>
          Most of my work experience has been in nonprofits. I have worked in museums for the past 7 years, primarily in education. Most people associate museum education with field trips or tours, but the vast majority of my work has been administrative: program/project management, staff supervision, budget development, data analysis, and event administration. One of my favorite parts of my most recent museum job was implementing a new scholarship administration software. I like taking a brand new project and carrying it from an initial idea to a finished project.

        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p> I have a lot of goals, some personal and some professional. One of my personal goals is to set a new personal record for a half marathon. I ran my first half marathon in summer 2019 and loved it so much that I immediately signed up for a second race. <div> My professional goal is work in a nonprofit tech company as a software developer. Through this website and other projects, I am hoping to hone my developer skills. My biggest goal is to leverage my new skills to move to Ireland, which has a huge tech industry.
