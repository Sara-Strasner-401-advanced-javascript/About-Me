        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>
          Welcome to my About Me page! As you can see above, my name is Sara Strasner, and I am glad to hear that you are interested in learning more about me. <div>I was born and raised in Louisiana, and moved to Seattle in 2013 for graduate school. When I'm not working on this beautiful website, I enjoy running, yoga, and reading. I typically read fiction, and my guilty pleasure is the Outlander series (tv and books!). I also really enjoy travelling. I recently traveled to Ireland and Scotland and immediately loved both places.

        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p> I have a lot of goals, some personal and some professional. One of my personal goals is to set a new personal record for a half marathon. I ran my first half marathon in summer 2019 and loved it so much that I immediately signed up for a second race. <div> My professional goal is work in a nonprofit tech company as a software developer. Through this website and other projects, I am hoping to hone my developer skills. My biggest goal is to leverage my new skills to move to Ireland, which has a huge tech industry.
